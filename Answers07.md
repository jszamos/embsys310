a., b., c., d., e.: all done <br><br>
<b>2.</b>
a. 376 + 80 = 456 bytes <br>
b. 8268 bytes  <br>
c. main.o uses 152 of 376 bytes
d.the stack<br><br><br>
<b>3.</b><br>
a) Reduce ROM usage <br>
 1 - turn on optimization. On mediun code drops to: "328 bytes of readonly  code memory" <br>
 2 - replace some of the startup routines <br>
 3 - inline or make macro as many functions as possible <br>
 4 - hand optimize a few code segments  <br>
b) Reduce RAM usage  <br> 
 1 - reduce the stack as much as possible <br>
