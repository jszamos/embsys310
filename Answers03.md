3.  a) Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized 
      sequences of two different signal durations -- dots and dashes.
    b) The Morse code was developed by Samuel Morse.

    Note, my implementation does a little more than specified in the assignment -- it goes through 
    a short list of words, and blinks them out in an infinite loop using LED1, using the correct 
    intra and inter character and inter word gaps.  Having additional words in an infinite loop was 
    mostly done to verify the correctness of my initial implementation. 
    The end of each cycle is indicated by by turning on LED2 for 17 units.
